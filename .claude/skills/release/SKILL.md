description: How to cut an OpenAether release — what has to be proven first, what a version number is allowed to assert, and what the notes must admit. Use when tagging, writing release notes, or deciding whether a release is ready.

# Cutting a release

The authority is `docs/release-checklist.md` in OpenAether-infra — run it, do
not summarise it. It is not linked relatively here because this skill is shared
with OpenAether-apps, which has no such file. This is only what the checklist cannot tell you.

## A version number is a claim

A tag asserts that something was proven. The 1.x tags were cut before deploy,
idempotency and upgrade had ever been run on a real cloud — the very things they
were meant to certify — and every one of them, releases included, was deleted.
0.1.0 is the first number this project puts on something it measured. Decide what
the number asserts, prove exactly that, then tag.

**Say which rung each claim reached.** Mocked, emulated, real cloud once by hand,
or unattended and repeated. "Proven at the real-cloud rung on Scaleway and OVH,
blocked upstream on Outscale" is a release note. "Proven" is a hope.

## The two repositories are independent

Infra no longer pins an OpenAether-apps tag: the `envs/*.tfvars.example` carry
`git_ref = "refs/heads/main"`, so there is no ordering constraint between the
two and no matching-version rule to honour. If a release ever reintroduces a
pin, the pinned ref has to exist before the thing pointing at it — and that
constraint belongs back in this file the same day.

## Order, and why

1. Everything in `§1`–`§7` of the checklist, on real clouds, **torn down**, with
   `scripts/ops/purge-orphans/` clean on each. Nothing left billing.
2. A GitHub release, with notes that name the limits.
3. Re-clone the published tag into a scratch directory and read it as a stranger:
   licence, changelog, examples, **no real tfvars in the archive** — and check
   that the quick start's commands exist and its values are accepted.

## The notes must admit what is not fixed

Someone upgrading a cluster that matters will hit the open items before they hit
the features. Name them, say what happens, and point at `docs/backlog.md`. A
release note that only lists what works is a release note that will be believed
about the rest.

## Withdrawing a tag

Only when nothing was published under it — no release, no dependent tag — and
only by saying so in the changelog and the release notes. Anyone who fetched the
old tag gets different content under the same name; that is not something to
discover, it is something to be told.

**Reusing a number that has already carried a published release is a different
act, and a heavier one.** It rewrites what a version means for anyone who
already has it. If the scope has changed enough to justify starting over, the
honest move is usually a new number — a major bump for a breaking change of
scope, or dropping back below 1.0.0 to say plainly that the interface is not yet
settled. Reusing the same number twice teaches people the numbers mean nothing.
That is why the restart is **0.1.0** rather than the next 1.x: those numbers were
published and then deleted, and a first release that ships something proven
belongs below them, where the interface is plainly not settled yet.
