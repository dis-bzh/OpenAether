# Backlog

What is left to do, and why. **Open items only** — a done entry belongs to git
history, not here. English only (rewritten every session; two copies would drift).

Keep it short: one entry = the defect, its cost, what to do. Detail lives in the
code comment, the runbook or the commit message, referenced by path.

⚠️ This file drifted into a lab notebook (215 lines, one entry at 32) and was cut
back on 2026-07-29. If an entry starts explaining what was ruled out, the
explanation belongs in the commit that ruled it out.

## Where we stand

Alerting exists and is proven end to end: 19 rules, a real alert delivered to
Slack from a Scaleway cluster, and a `Watchdog` whose silence is the signal.
etcd, Cilium, Flux and cert-manager are scraped. Everything is torn down.

## Open — work we can do

- [ ] **Log in to a UI through the gateway.** The transport is DONE (2026-07-29,
      Scaleway): `https://longhorn.openaether.local` answers **HTTP 200** through
      the gateway, served with `CN=openaether.local` issued by our own
      intermediate. What is left is only the Grafana↔Zitadel claim form, which
      needs `grafana-oidc` seeded and a human browser.
      Two traps found doing it: import the signed intermediate ALONE (the root
      too and OpenBao picks an issuer with no private key), and re-signing the
      same subject needs `unique_subject = no` in `index.txt.attr` — the `.cnf`
      is not what controls it.
      ⚠️ The LB-IPAM VIP is not reachable from the bastion; reach the gateway by
      port-forward or from inside the cluster.

- [~] **Flux has no per-object Ready signal.** `gotk_reconcile_condition` is gone
      in Flux 2.8; `FluxReconciliationStalled` covers "stopped", not "failing".
      The kube-state-metrics `customResourceState` route produced a series
      exactly once and could not be reproduced (elimination list in `9ac133d`).
      Asked upstream 2026-07-29: kubernetes/kube-state-metrics#3052. Waiting —
      do not spend more time guessing at config.

## Blocked on the world, not on us

Not work. Conditions. Do not re-investigate them from a desk.

- [ ] **Proxmox never applied for real** — needs the hardware. Plus Ansible host
      hardening, documented but absent from the repo.

- [ ] **OVH: a node can stay `ACTIVE` while dead.** `vp_reset` is virtio-pci's
      reset; `device_shutdown()` runs on every reboot path, so no Talos-side
      lever avoids it — only a hypervisor reset, which the recovery already
      prescribes. Detection is covered by `NodeUnreachable`. The root cause
      needs the incident to recur WITH the serial console attached.

- [ ] **Outscale RAM quota (40 GB) vs an HA management (44 GB).** The overrun is
      tolerated at creation, then every further VM is refused silently.
      `task preflight-quotas` catches it; raising the quota is your call.

- [~] **`talos_cluster_health` times out on healthy clusters.** OVH and Outscale
      only — Scaleway passed a full apply on 2026-07-29, so the entry's old
      "generic defect" claim was wrong. Damage is contained (`skip_health_check`,
      and the kubeconfig no longer depends on it). Upstream 0.11.0 is still the
      newest stable. Filing needs evidence from an OVH or Outscale run:
      `TF_LOG=DEBUG` on the failing read, `talosctl health` at the same moment,
      and one run with `skip_kubernetes_checks = true`.

## Traps worth remembering

One line each; the detail lives in the referenced file.

- **Flux substitution applies to a whole Kustomization render** — it blanks bare
  shell variables. Isolate `substituteFrom` in a brick with no script
  (`22a-backup-identity.yaml`).
- **An operator and its own CRs need two Kustomizations** — a bundle with both is
  rejected at dry-run while the CRDs do not exist yet.
- **`toServices: kubernetes` gets dropped** — the Service DNATs 443→6443 and
  Cilium enforces on the post-DNAT port. Use `toEntities: kube-apiserver`.
- **A Kustomize `namespace:` overrides every resource**, including those of a
  referenced base — that is why `vault-ca` is a separate brick.
- **Validating a file is not validating the brick**: apply the directory
  (`kubectl apply -k`), never an isolated file.
- **`clusterctl move --dry-run` does not check providers** — it passes, and the
  real move fails.
- **Before translating a string, check that no code compares it** — `pick.py`
  identified its profiles by their French header.
- **Never conclude from truncated output** — a `| tail` hid the servers that
  `purge-orphans` lists first, making a populated account look clean.
- **An empty server list is not an empty account** — 7 Scaleway block volumes
  billed for three days behind a clean-looking instance list. Check volumes.
- **`clusterctl init` does not install ORC** — CAPO v0.14 needs it, and without
  it the manager exits: network/LB/FIPs get created but no server ever does.
  See `capi-bootstrap.md`.
- **Outscale `region` ≠ subregion** — `eu-west-2a` in the credentials secret
  builds an API host that does not resolve. Use `eu-west-2`.
- **A generated artifact drifts silently** — hence `task render-check` and
  `pick.py --check`. Prefer guardrails that compare over ones that assume.
- **`up == 0` only catches NODE-discovered targets** — a pod target vanishes
  from discovery instead of reporting 0, and an absent series matches nothing.
  Full reasoning in the `CiliumAgentMissing` rule comment.
- **A rule on a metric nobody produces never fires, and never says so** —
  `task check-alerts` asks a live cluster which referenced metrics have no data.
- **`repeat_interval` must be strictly greater than `group_interval`** —
  Alertmanager sent one webhook in 11 min when both were 5m, which would trip a
  dead-man's switch on a healthy cluster.
- **A failed Job is permanent under Flux** — it re-applies the same spec and
  never restarts a finished Job. A bootstrap Job must WAIT for its dependency,
  not exit; `openbao-vault-bootstrap` left a cluster with no KV and no PKI while
  its Kustomization reported Ready.
- **A `VMRule` with no `VMAlert` is inert** — stored, never evaluated, and no
  component reports the gap.
- **kube-state-metrics needs `honorLabels: true`** — otherwise its labels become
  `exported_*` and every rule selecting on `namespace`/`pod` matches nothing.
- **A component's metrics port is often its service port** — vmselect serves
  queries AND /metrics on 8481. Removing a CNP rule as "query-only" took the
  self-scrape down with it. Check `up == 0` after touching an observability CNP.
- **A batch translation leaves half-translated blocks** — a French line between
  two English ones reads as finished and no linter catches it. Sweep, don't trust.
