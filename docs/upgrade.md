# Upgrading a live cluster — Kubernetes and Talos

🇫🇷 [Version française](upgrade.fr.md)

## The two facts everything here follows from

**A node's boot image is only the medium it was installed from.** After
`talosctl upgrade` the instance still reports the old image id, by design. Node
resources therefore carry `ignore_changes` on it — see
[`provider-contract.md` § Node image drift](../infrastructure/opentofu/modules/providers/provider-contract.md).
Without that, bumping `talos_version` would make a routine apply replace every
control plane at once and etcd would lose quorum.

**Talos supports a window of Kubernetes releases, not all of them.**
`cluster/versions-guard.tf` refuses an unsupported pair at plan time, and refuses
a Talos minor nobody has entered in its map rather than passing it silently. The
starting pair, the ending pair *and* the intermediate state all have to sit
inside the window, because the two move one at a time.

## Measure the interruption

Start this before anything, against the endpoint in the kubeconfig — never a
tunnel to one node, because that node is the one you are about to take away.

```bash
while :; do kubectl get --raw=/readyz --request-timeout=2s >/dev/null 2>&1 \
  && echo ok || echo FAIL; sleep 1; done | tee probe.log
```

A clean run loses a few seconds while an apiserver restarts. The hand-run on
2026-08-13 lost three.

## Kubernetes first

It reboots nothing, so it isolates the control-plane roll from the node roll.

```bash
# edit kubernetes_version in envs/<role>-<provider>.tfvars, then
task infra ROLE=management PROVIDER=<p>
```

Talos reconciles the static pods and the kubelets; wait for every node to report
the new version before moving on. Note that this bypasses `talosctl upgrade-k8s`,
which sequences those components behind health checks — see `backlog.md`.

## Then Talos, in place

Bump `talos_version`, build the image for the new version (the node resources
ignore the image, but the *data source* still has to resolve), apply, then roll.

```bash
task talos-image PROVIDER=<p> VERSION=<new> ENSURE=1
# edit talos_version in the tfvars, then
task infra ROLE=management PROVIDER=<p>
task rolling-replace PROVIDER=<p> KEY=~/.ssh/<key> -- --cp-only --upgrade
task rolling-replace PROVIDER=<p> KEY=~/.ssh/<key> -- --workers-only --upgrade
```

`--upgrade` calls `talosctl upgrade`, which keeps the node's disk, identity and
etcd membership, drains it itself, and refuses a control-plane upgrade that would
cost etcd its quorum. One node at a time, health-gated between each, and
re-runnable: a node already on the target version is skipped. Control planes
first — a worker needs a healthy control plane to drain against.

### The cluster has to be able to lose a node

Check this before rolling, not after a drain has waited out its timeout:

```bash
kubectl describe nodes -l '!node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane' | grep -E '^Name:|^  cpu '
```

Requests must leave one node's worth of room. Measured 2026-08-15: Scaleway's
three `DEV1-L` workers sat at 72/47/27% and every drain went through; OVH's
three `b3-8` at 78/99/100% and the first drain waited out its full 900s with no
eviction error to show for it — the evicted pods simply had nowhere to go, so
the budgets they belong to never recovered. Add a worker or a bigger flavour
before rolling; that is a prerequisite, not a symptom.

### What actually blocks a drain, and the two gates that clear it

**A CNPG primary is unevictable while it is primary.** The operator publishes a
`<cluster>-primary` budget at `disruptionsAllowed=0 / currentHealthy=1 /
expectedPods=1`, and `nodeMaintenanceWindow` does not relax it — measured on
Scaleway 2026-08-15: with the window on, CNPG deletes the *replica* budget and
keeps the primary one. That is the whole 900s drain.

So the roll sets **`spec.enablePDB: false`** on every CNPG cluster while it
rolls, and back to `true` on exit. That removes both budgets, primary included;
the operator's own webhook recommends it over the maintenance window. The
primary is then evicted like any other pod and CNPG fails over to a replica —
an unplanned failover, which is what the node reboot was going to cause seconds
later anyway. The maintenance window stays set alongside it, because that is
what tells the operator to reuse the PVC instead of reprovisioning an instance
that node-local storage could not move.

**Everything else quorum-shaped blocks it too.** Three runs on 2026-08-14 stopped
on three different pods — CNPG replicas, `kube-state-metrics`, then `openbao-1`
on a raft budget wanting 2 of 3 — with no CNPG primary involved in the last one.
The shape was always the same: the roll arrived at the next node while the
previous one's workloads were still rejoining. So before cordoning, it waits
until **every budget covering a pod on that node reports
`disruptionsAllowed >= 1`**.

It waits only on budgets that can still recover (`currentHealthy < expectedPods`).
Some are zero by construction — `<cluster>-primary`, Longhorn's
`instance-manager-*`, a single-replica `kube-state-metrics` — and waiting on
those is waiting forever.

If a drain still times out, the roll **refuses** and names the pods rather than
rebooting the node under them. Do not force past it: the version this replaced
warned and rebooted anyway, which left `zitadel-db` stuck mid-switchover and
`grafana-db` with no active instance. Re-run the same command once the pod is
healthy — nodes already on the target version are skipped.

```bash
# what is refusing, on the node the roll named
kubectl get pdb -A -o custom-columns=NS:.metadata.namespace,NAME:.metadata.name,\
ALLOWED:.status.disruptionsAllowed,HEALTHY:.status.currentHealthy,EXPECTED:.status.expectedPods

# CNPG state — the qualified name is required: on a cluster carrying CAPI,
# `kubectl get cluster` means clusters.cluster.x-k8s.io, not this one.
kubectl get clusters.postgresql.cnpg.io -A -o custom-columns=NS:.metadata.namespace,\
NAME:.metadata.name,PRIMARY:.status.currentPrimary,READY:.status.readyInstances

# and, for one database in detail (plugin installed by `task setup`)
kubectl cnpg status <cluster> -n <ns>
```

⚠️ **The first apply after a `talos_version` bump fails on OVH and Outscale**
with "Provider produced inconsistent final plan", once per machine config.
Nothing is left half-applied; re-run it. This is upstream
`siderolabs/terraform-provider-talos` #352, fixed only in the 0.12.0 pre-release
line — details and the decision still open in `backlog.md`.

## What to check, beyond "it came back"

After each node, and again at the end:

- **its name is unchanged** — a `talos-xxxxx` entry means the hostname did not
  hold, and the next reboot will orphan another node object
- the node count has not grown, and etcd still reports every member
- the probe's FAIL count has barely moved
- **`tofu plan` is empty.** If it wants to replace nodes, the boot image and the
  running version have disagreed — that plan would take the cluster down. Stop
  and read § Node image drift before running anything else.

```bash
task plan ROLE=management PROVIDER=<p> STRICT=1   # exit 2 = not converged
```

## Replacing a node rather than upgrading it

`--upgrade` cannot carry an `instance_type`, disk or zone change, nor a new image
schematic — those need a new VM. Same script, without `--upgrade`: it drains,
applies a targeted `-replace`, and waits, one node at a time. That path *does*
need the new cloud image to exist.
