# flux-install.yaml pins its seven controller images by TAG only (#119) — a tag
# force-moved upstream changes not one byte of the committed YAML, so nothing
# in this repository would notice: `task render-check` re-renders from the
# same pinned tag, Cléa has no `# renovate:` anchor on these lines, and Trivy
# has this file in `skip-files`. This is the OTHER half of #119 (the offline
# half — sha256 of the file itself — is upstream-artifacts.lock): resolve each
# tag to the digest ghcr.io serves TODAY and compare it to the one recorded
# below the last time this ran.
#
# Needs the network (an anonymous ghcr.io token, same as `docker pull` would
# use) but never a cloud account — same rung distinction Cléa's probes draw.
# Not part of `task lint`, which must stay fully offline.
#
# Usage:
#   check-flux-image-digests.sh          # compare against the recorded lock
#   check-flux-image-digests.sh --write  # resolve current digests and rewrite the lock
