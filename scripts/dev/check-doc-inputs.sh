# The rule this enforces is the release criterion itself: deploy, idempotency,
# upgrade and backup must work by FOLLOWING THE DOCUMENTATION, without
# correction. A required variable that no document mentions is a deploy that
# fails on a stranger's first attempt and works on ours, which is the same shape
# as every false-green this repository keeps meeting — it passes for us because
# we already know the answer.
#
# Source of truth is the CODE: a variable in cluster/variables.tf with no
# `default` is required, by definition, and nothing else is. Documentation is
# what gets checked against it, never the other way round.
#
# Usage: check-doc-inputs.sh
#   STRICT_EXAMPLES=0  skip the "the example carries every required field" check
