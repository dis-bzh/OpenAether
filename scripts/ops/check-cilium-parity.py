"""Checks that the CHILD (CAPI) clusters' Cilium stays aligned with the foundation.

Why this check exists
---------------------------
The parent foundation configures Cilium through `helm template --set …` in
`scripts/bootstrap/render-bootstrap-manifests.sh`; the CAPI children configure
it through the `values:` block of a HelmRelease in
`OpenAether-apps/apps/clusters/*.yaml`. Two formats, two repositories, no
mechanical link: the drift is silent and only shows up in production.

It cost dearly on 2026-07-26: the children had lost `ipam.mode=kubernetes`.
The chart default (`cluster-pool`) ignores the `clusterNetwork.pods` declared
by CAPI and carves pod CIDRs out of 10.0.0.0/8 — the very /8 where the node
subnets live (10.20.0.0/24 on OpenStack, 10.0.0.0/24 for OVH, Outscale and
Proxmox). The parent sets it explicitly, for exactly
that reason.

What the check does
-----------------------
It compares, key by key, a restricted set of "structural" settings between the
render script's production block and each child's `*-cilium` HelmRelease.
INTENDED differences are declared in EXCEPTIONS with their rationale: an
undeclared divergence fails the check.

Usage: python3 scripts/ops/check-cilium-parity.py   (exit 1 on drift)
