# Emulated cloud (Feint) — create/read/update/delete against a local emulator.
#
# WHY A SEPARATE ROOT. The cluster root cannot apply here: it always builds a
# Scaleway public gateway and IPAM reservations, and Outscale security groups,
# public IPs, route tables and load balancers — none of which the emulator
# serves. This root carries the same SHAPES over the subset it does serve, so a
# real apply/destroy cycle runs with no account. Coverage and the exact gaps:
# docs/emulated-cloud.md.
#
# One provider per apply, like the cluster root — target_provider selects it.
