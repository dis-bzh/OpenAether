# S3-compatible encrypted backup / disaster recovery.
#
# Backs up the access artifacts (talosconfig, kubeconfig) to TWO stores: primary
# (the cluster's provider) and replica (a different provider in prod). Machine
# configs are deliberately NOT backed up — they embed ~1.8 MB of inline
# manifests and are derivable from the machine secrets, which already live in
# the encrypted tfstate (the real DR artifact).
#
# Encryption: client-side gpg AES-256 with the SAME passphrase as the tfstate
# (that is what protects the data), plus S3 SSE on top.
#
# ⚠️ Uses the AWS CLI rather than aws_s3_object: that resource hits a
# "version_id known -> now unknown" plan-consistency bug on non-AWS S3 stores.
#
# The tfstate's own replication is a separate post-apply step
# (scripts/ops/backup-state.sh): the backend only flushes it after the apply.
