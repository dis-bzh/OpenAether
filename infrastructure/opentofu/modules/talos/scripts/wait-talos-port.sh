#
# Two ways to get this wrong, both met on 2026-08-12/13:
#
#  1. A bare TCP connect. On cloud the endpoint is an SSH tunnel on 127.0.0.1 and
#     `ssh -L` accepts locally whatever the far end is doing, so it returned
#     "reachable" in 4ms against a node that was not running. Everything
#     downstream then fired into the void: the machine config applied in 0s to
#     nobody and the health gate waited 600s for a kubelet nobody had configured.
#
#  2. `talosctl version`. It prints a "Server:" block with a Tag and exits 0 even
#     when nothing answers, so neither its status nor its output separates a live
#     node from a closed port. Replacing (1) with it turned the guard into one
#     that could never succeed and cost a full deployment.
#
# What does separate them is the transport error of a real API call. A node in
# maintenance mode answers the TLS handshake with a self-signed certificate —
# x509 error, but an ANSWER. A dead endpoint refuses the connection or times out.
# A configured node answers properly. So: anything but a transport failure means
# the API is up and will take a config.

# timeout, not hang the whole `tofu apply`/CI job indefinitely.
MAX_WAIT_SECONDS="${MAX_WAIT_SECONDS:-900}"
ELAPSED=0

#  3. `talosctl` WITHOUT A TALOSCONFIG. The local-exec passes ENDPOINT and NODE
#     and nothing else, so talosctl fails with "failed to resolve configuration
#     context: talos config file is empty" — never opening a socket. That string
#     is not a transport error, so the probe below read it as "the API answered"
#     and returned true on its first attempt, every time, on every provider.
#     Measured 2026-08-18 on Outscale: the guard passed in 0s, the six config
#     applies then spent 15 minutes each dialling tunnels that were not there and
#     died on "connect: connection refused". The guard existed precisely to
#     prevent that and had never once run.
#
# So the probe asks two questions that need no configuration at all:
#   a) is anything LISTENING locally — `connection refused` means the tunnel
#      itself is gone, which no amount of node readiness will fix;
#   b) does the far end complete a TLS handshake — apid answers with a
#      certificate even in maintenance mode, so a handshake means a live Talos,
#      while an `ssh -L` whose far end is dead accepts and then closes.
# Together they separate the three states the earlier versions confused.
